      <h4>Hi guys,</h4>
In this post, I’m going to share my full journey in electronics projects – how I started with small boards like Arduino Uno, Raspberry Pi, and ESP32, and slowly built so many fun and useful projects. Trust me, I didn’t know anything in the beginning, but now I can confidently connect sensors, displays, modules and make my own gadgets.

<hr>

<h2>Where It All Started – Arduino Uno</h2>
The very first board I got was Arduino Uno. Honestly, at that time, I didn’t even know what microcontrollers were. I just bought the board because I saw some cool YouTube videos.

At first, I struggled a lot:

-I didn’t know how to install the Arduino IDE.
-I didn’t know how to upload code.
-Even simple “Hello World” on a display used to confuse me.

But slowly, I learned the basics. My first big success was making text appear on a 16x2 LCD display using the I2C module. It looked so simple, but I was so happy because something I connected was showing text!

<hr>

<h2>Playing with Sensors and Displays</h2>
Once I understood the basics, I started experimenting with different sensors and displays:

-> RFID-RC522 sensor: I built a small prototype of an access control system. It could detect cards and show messages on the LCD.

-> 8-segment display: I learned how to show numbers from 0-9 using Arduino. It was tricky because you need to control each segment with the right pin combination.

-> Temperature and motion sensors: I tried simple IoT-type projects like showing temperature on the display or turning on an LED when someone moves.

I was learning through trial and error. Sometimes the code wouldn’t compile, sometimes the connections would be wrong. But every small success pushed me forward.

<hr>

<h2>Getting My First Raspberry Pi</h2>
After Arduino, I wanted to do bigger projects. That’s when I got my Raspberry Pi 4. This was a game-changer because it’s like a mini-computer.

I used the Pi for:

-> Cloud server: I turned it into my own home cloud using TrueNAS and pendrives as storage.
-> Websites: I learned how to host my own websites from the Pi.
-> IoT projects: I connected sensors and controlled them using Python scripts.
-> RFID and camera modules: I integrated RFID readers and camera modules to make smart gadgets.

At one point, my Pi stopped booting and only the red light was glowing. I even learned about EEPROM recovery to fix the bootloader! These problems actually taught me how to troubleshoot properly.

<hr>

<h2>ESP32 and Wi-Fi Projects</h2>
Then I got into ESP32 because it has built-in Wi-Fi and Bluetooth. This made it perfect for IoT and wireless projects.

Some experiments I did:

:) ESP32 Camera module: I set up live video streaming that could be accessed from anywhere.

:) Milk vending machine prototype: I connected QR code scanning and a website interface with the ESP32. Since I didn’t have a pump or relay at that time, I tested the setup using an LED light.

The ESP32 allowed me to connect my hardware to the internet easily. I learned how to send and receive data using APIs, which helped me in future projects.

<hr>

<h2>LoRa Long-Range Communication</h2>
I also experimented with LoRa modules (SX1278). These modules can send data over a long distance without Wi-Fi or internet.

I tried setting up two LoRa modules to communicate with each other like walkie-talkies but for data. My plan is to build a system where sensors can send information even in remote areas.

<hr>

<h2>Challenges I Faced</h2>
This journey was not smooth at all. Here are some challenges I faced:

-Power supply issues: My 12V lead-acid Amaron battery sometimes drained or didn’t power modules properly.
-Debugging errors: Arduino IDE and Raspberry Pi terminal errors used to scare me.
-Hardware failures: Some components stopped working because I connected them wrong.
-Networking issues: Setting up DDNS, port forwarding, and Cloudflare tunnels was confusing at first.

But I took each problem as a learning opportunity.

<hr>

<h2>What I Learned from Electronics</h2>
`Patience is key: Sometimes a single wire in the wrong place can break everything.

`Read datasheets: Understanding pinouts and voltage limits is very important.

`Start small: First get an LED blinking, then add more features.

`Safety matters: Don’t mess with high voltage without proper knowledge.

<hr>

<h2>Big Projects That Made Me Confident</h2>
Here are some of the big electronics projects I successfully built:

Milk Vending Machine Prototype: QR scanner, ESP32, and website interface.
Raspberry Pi Cloud Server: Store and access files from anywhere using Dynu DDNS and Cloudflare tunnels.
ESP32 Camera Streaming: Access live video feed from outside the local network.
LoRa Communication Setup: Testing long-range communication without internet.
Access Control System: Using RFID and LCD display.

Each project taught me something new and pushed me closer to becoming a proper maker.

<hr>

<h2>Where I’m Headed Next</h2>
I’m planning to:

Build complete IoT solutions with ESP32 and Raspberry Pi.

Create advanced LoRa-based communication systems.

Make electronics projects that connect with my websites and apps.

I’m also planning to share tutorials on Instagram and YouTube so others can also learn from my journey.

<hr>

<h2>Advice for Beginners in Electronics</h2>
If you’re just starting out, here’s my advice:

Get an Arduino kit: Learn the basics of coding and connecting sensors.

Watch YouTube tutorials: But also try to experiment on your own.

Don’t fear errors: Everyone faces them, even pros.

Keep a notebook: Write down pinouts and steps, it helps a lot.

<hr>

<h2>Final Words</h2>
Electronics has completely changed the way I see technology. From just connecting wires randomly, now I’m confident to build full systems.
