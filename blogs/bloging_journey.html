    <h3>Hey friends,</h3>
Today I want to share the complete story of how I built my own blogging website from scratch and slowly started applying for Google Adsense. Honestly, I had zero knowledge when I started, but step by step I figured it out. If I can do it, you can also do it.

<hr>

<h2>Why I Wanted to Start a Blog</h2>
At first, I was just doing small electronics projects and building websites for fun. But then I realized, “Why not share my journey online?” I wanted to write about my projects, my learnings, and also earn a little bit from it.

That’s when I decided to create a proper blog website. I didn’t want to depend on anyone. I wanted full control of my website, design, and content.

<hr>

<h2>Choosing Tech for My Blog</h2>
I started with the basics – HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. I didn’t use WordPress or Blogger because I wanted to learn how things work under the hood.

--HTML: To build the structure of the blog (pages, posts, links).

--CSS: To make it look nice and mobile friendly.

--JavaScript: To add interactivity and dynamic functions.

Later, I integrated Firebase for storing my blog posts and handling the backend. Firebase was very beginner-friendly and allowed me to focus on the frontend design first.

<hr>

<h2>Designing the Blog Layout</h2>
I spent a lot of time on how the blog should look. I didn’t want it to be messy. So I created:

-Homepage: List of latest posts with thumbnails.
-Single Post Page: Each post opens with a proper title, image, and content.
-Navigation bar: Simple and clean with “Home” and “About Me.”
-Footer: Links to my socials and basic copyright info.

I made sure the design was mobile friendly, because most people read blogs from their phone.

<hr>

<h2>Adding Blog Posts</h2>
Once the structure was ready, I started adding posts. This is the fun part! I wrote about my projects, experiments, and small tips.

I used Firebase Firestore to store my blog data. Every post has:

->Title
->Content
->Date
->Thumbnail image

Whenever a visitor opens my blog, it fetches the latest posts from Firebase and displays them. This was a huge learning experience for me.

<hr>

<h2>Making My Blog SEO-Friendly</h2>
Google won’t show your blog to others if it’s not SEO-friendly. So I learned small SEO tricks:

>Meta tags: I added proper meta description and keywords for each page.
>Alt text for images: Google loves this.
>Fast loading: I optimized images and removed unwanted code.
>Mobile friendly: I tested using Google’s mobile-friendly tool.

I also checked my Lighthouse report (from Chrome DevTools) and improved whatever issues it showed.

<hr>

<h2>Google Analytics & Monitoring</h2>
I wanted to see who visits my blog and from where. So I added Google Analytics.

It was super simple:

Sign up for Analytics -> Copy the tracking code (gtag.js) -> Paste it inside the <head> tag of my HTML


Now I can track how many people visit, which posts are popular, and how they found my blog.

<hr>

<h2>Applying for Google Adsense</h2>
Once I had a decent number of posts, I applied for Google Adsense. Adsense is the best way to show ads on your site and earn money.

Here’s how I did it:

Went to Google Adsense. -> Signed up with my Gmail. -> Added my blog URL for verification. -> 

Placed the Adsense verification code in my site’s <head>. -> Submitted for review.



Now, Google will check if my blog follows all the policies. It usually takes 2-3 weeks for approval.

<hr>

<h2>Challenges I Faced</h2>
It was not an easy ride. Some problems I faced:

Broken image links: I forgot to upload images to my folder sometimes.
Console errors: While adding dynamic Firebase posts, I saw random errors.
Lighthouse report warnings: SEO and accessibility issues used to show up often.
Adsense rejection fear: I was scared Google will reject my site.

But I kept fixing one issue at a time. I didn’t rush.

It will give you more context about where I came from and how I built all this.</p>


<hr>

<h2>What I Learned in This Blogging Journey</h2>
Content is king: Google wants original content. I write everything in my own words.

Consistency matters: You can’t write one post and wait. Keep posting.
Design clean: Visitors should easily navigate.
Follow policies: No copied content, no illegal stuff, and don’t trick users.

<hr>

<h2>My Current Blog Goals</h2>
I’m writing more posts (like this one you’re reading now) to grow my blog. My target is to reach Adsense approval and then keep growing my traffic.

I’m also improving my blog speed and design continuously. For example:

Optimizing images

Adding favicon and logo

Improving mobile friendliness

I want my blog to look and feel professional even though I built it on my own.

<hr>

<h2>Advice for Beginners</h2>
If you want to start a blog, don’t wait for the perfect time. Start now!

Use simple HTML/CSS or WordPress if you’re not into coding.

Write about what you know or what you’re learning.

Don’t focus on earning on day 1. Build value first.

One day, your blog will start getting visitors and you can monetize it.

<hr>

<h2>What’s Next for Me</h2>
I’m planning to write at least 15+ quality blog posts and improve SEO. After Adsense approval, I’ll experiment with affiliate marketing and maybe launch my own digital products.

I’ll also write about all my projects (electronics, AI assistant, servers, websites) on this blog. That way, others can learn and get inspired.
